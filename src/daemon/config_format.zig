//! Orochi daemon configuration: a typed `Config` projected from standard TOML.
//!
//! The canonical config format is **TOML v1.0** (parsed by `proto/toml.zig`).
//! `parseToml` reads a TOML document and overlays it onto a defaulted `Config`,
//! preserving the daemon's value conventions:
//!   * `env:NAME` / `@file:path` string indirection, resolved via `Resolver`.
//!   * durations as quoted strings: `"500ms"`, `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"2h"`.
//!   * operators as a TOML array-of-tables: `[[opers]]` with `account`/`class`.
//! A field is overridden only when the document supplies it; otherwise the
//! defaults stand. Required: `[node].id` and `[listen].irc`.

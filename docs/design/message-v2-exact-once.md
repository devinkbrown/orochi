# MESSAGE_V2 durable exact-once integration contract

Status: canonical signed codec, secured exact-wire transport, Lotus exact-once
ingestion, durable RVG2 replay authority, and mandatory Helix relation are
implemented. The daemon integration must follow the transaction below.

## Immutable transport object

`message_relay_v2.RelayMessage` signs every routing, rendering, logical-session,
origin, and HLC field. `verifyAndRelayId` validates semantics, constructs one
canonical transcript, verifies its Ed25519 proof, and derives one 16-byte
`RelayId` from those same authenticated bytes.

`InboundMessageV2` retains three views of one received object:

- `wire`: the exact canonical inner MESSAGE_V2 bytes;
- `owned.msg`: the decoded immutable fields used for policy and delivery; and
- `via_peer`: the authenticated immediate transport hop.

The CoilPack decoder rejects non-canonical maps, duplicate/unknown/missing keys,
overlong encodings, and trailing data. After daemon-global acceptance, forward
only `wire` through `forwardMessageV2`; never re-encode `owned.msg` in transit.
The forward API wraps the unchanged inner image in the next hop's signed,
encrypted envelope and returns `false` without writing on the ingress leg.

The per-link SeenSet is outbound-only reflection suppression. Verified inbound
duplicates are intentionally queued again: a prior drained copy might have met
a recoverable daemon rejection such as OOM or incomplete restore/registry
convergence. Only the durable global guard decides duplicate delivery.

## One accepted identity

Call `relay_v2_replay_guard.Guard.admitMessage(msg)`. It verifies the origin and
returns:

- `accepted: RelayId`;
- `duplicate`, `equivocation`, `retired`, or `origin_capacity`; or
- `origin_mismatch`, `bad_signature`, or `invalid_semantic`.

Only `accepted` carries an identity. That exact payload is the message identity
for Lotus, rendered msgid/server-time state, audit correlation, and forwarding.
Do not call `relayId` again after admission.

## Transactional guard and Lotus publication

Serialize this lane under one daemon-owned replay/history mutation lock
(`relay_v2_replay_mu`). The shipped entry point is
`admitRelayV2Detailed(msg, history, outbox, delivery)`
(`src/daemon/server.zig:10443`); its `.accepted` is the only outcome that
authorizes live delivery, SearchIndex projection, or exact-wire re-forwarding.
Up to five authorities join one no-fail cut — the RVG2 replay guard, the Lotus
history store, the RVL2 accepted-event log, the RVO2 per-hop outbox, and the
ADS1 attachment delivery spool — and `outbox`/`delivery` are omitted only on the
inbound history-only path.

1. Decode the retained canonical wire and prevalidate every daemon-owned bound
   and policy input: scope, target/history key, command, sender prefix, client
   tags, text, timestamp conversion, and the final RelayId-to-msgid encoding.
   A value this build cannot preserve exactly is rejected before any authority
   moves.
2. Stage a complete RVG2 replay-guard candidate from the live checkpoint and
   call `candidate.admitMessage(msg)` exactly once; only `accepted => relay_id`
   proceeds (`src/daemon/server.zig:10457`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10466`). No
   live object has changed yet.
3. When an outbox reservation is present, require the configured direct-neighbor
   membership (at least this node plus one neighbor) and stage a fully-allocated
   RVL2 `prepareAccepted` plan over the live accepted-event log; it must report
   `.inserted` (`src/daemon/server.zig:10481`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10482`,
   `src/daemon/server.zig:10496`).
4. When a history row is present, build the Lotus candidate from the live
   history checkpoint and call `ingestExactOnce` with the exact accepted id and
   signed fields; it must report `.inserted` (`src/daemon/server.zig:10507`,
   `src/daemon/server.zig:10513`).
5. Reserve every immediate-hop retransmission before any authority becomes live:
   `relay_v2_outbox.putBatchExcluding` is itself failure-atomic and is the last
   fallible step, copying the exact wire once per eligible neighbor and
   excluding the ingress hop (`src/daemon/server.zig:10534`).
6. No fallible work remains. Commit the prepared ADS1 delivery batch to publish
   the exact per-attachment rendered records, then swap the Lotus and RVG2
   candidates into their live stores and commit the RVL2 plan — every step here
   is allocation-free and cannot fail (`src/daemon/server.zig:10550`,
   `src/daemon/server.zig:10552`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10555`,
   `src/daemon/server.zig:10560`).
7. After that publication, update SearchIndex/metrics and perform local delivery
   and exact-wire mesh forwarding. Projection failure may be audited and
   repaired, but it must not roll back or duplicate the accepted authorities.

Every other combination is side-effect-free:

- replay `duplicate`/`retired`: no Lotus, delivery, search, stats, or forwarding;
- replay `equivocation` or proof/semantic/capacity rejection: audit and drop;
- an RVL2 `.conflict`, an out-of-capacity reservation, or replay `accepted` with
  Lotus `.exact_duplicate`/`.equivocation`: the staged authorities disagree, so
  publish no candidate, audit the invariant failure, and request repair;
- OOM anywhere before the first swap: deinitialize every candidate and leave all
  live checkpoints byte-identical.

A locally authored v2 message uses the same path before its first local delivery
or peer send. Encode the accepted signed object once and give every eligible
secured link that same canonical wire image.

## Direct-neighbor custody graph

Durable custody is scoped to the node's own direct neighbors, and three distinct
`[mesh]` root sets must not be conflated:

- `trust_roots` is the exact direct-neighbor set — the peer node identities this
  node pins for secured S2S — and is deliberately not a broad transitive trust
  list (`src/daemon/server.zig:3362`, `src/daemon/server.zig:3367`).
- `admission_roots` are the MeshPass token *signer* roots, a separate authority
  from peer node-identity pins (`src/daemon/server.zig:2020`).
- `relay_v2_roster` is the full secured-mesh node-key inventory used for
  activation; unlike `trust_roots` it is not limited to direct neighbors
  (`src/daemon/server.zig:2033`).

The RVL2 required-node set is derived once at init as this node plus the short
ids of every `trust_roots` neighbor, sorted and de-duplicated; a set that
contains the local node, a duplicate, or a short-id collision disables durable
membership rather than shipping a wrong custody graph
(`src/daemon/server.zig:3365`, `src/daemon/server.zig:4155`). A row in the
accepted-event log retires — dropping its retained wire — only once every
required node has durably confirmed it
(`src/daemon/relay_v2_event_log.zig:16`); until then the RVO2 outbox retains the
exact origin-signed wire per neighbor "until that peer authenticates an ACK"
(`src/daemon/relay_v2_outbox.zig:4`).

Custody advances only on an authenticated direct neighbor's ACK.
`relayV2DirectNeighbor` gates every custody transition on membership in the
required-node set (`src/daemon/server.zig:10681`). An inbound ACK records that
neighbor in the RVL2 confirmed set and retires its RVO2 obligation
(`commitRelayV2NeighborAck`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10870`); the receiver
retransmits its own ACK until the origin returns an ACK_CONFIRM
(`commitRelayV2IngressAckConfirm`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10895`), so a lost ACK
cannot age a custody proof out behind unrelated traffic. A duplicate inbound
edge in a cycle re-reserves that neighbor's receipt transactionally before
re-ACKing (`retainRelayV2DuplicateIngress`, `src/daemon/server.zig:10592`).

## Unified egress scheduler

Every MESSAGE_V2 egress — the just-accepted live case and all retransmission —
flows through one per-origin ordered scheduler; `forwardAcceptedRelayV2` does no
direct forwarding of its own and instead wakes reactor 0, which owns the S2S
links (`src/daemon/server.zig:10791`). Direct forwarding would let a newer
same-origin event overtake a still-retained older one and let RVG2 retire the
older event at the receiver.

`collectRelayV2RetryWork` round-robins a durable per-target cursor over the
required neighbors and asks the accepted-event log for one page per neighbor
(`src/daemon/server.zig:11054`, `src/daemon/server.zig:11065`,
`src/daemon/server.zig:11077`). `collectPageForNode` exposes at most the lowest
missing HLC per origin for that target — "a higher event can never overtake a
lower unconfirmed event and be retired by RVG2's greatest-W watermark" — and the
fairness cursor rotates *between* origins but never advances *within* one
(`src/daemon/relay_v2_event_log.zig:642`). The result is a strict per-origin
FIFO: no newer-before-older same-origin frame ever reaches a neighbor, even
across a backlog larger than the RVG2 per-origin window (a live-egress case the
tests pin explicitly, `src/daemon/server.zig:50701`). `retryRelayV2Outbox`
drains that work under a bounded per-pass frame/byte budget and applies the same
bounded, fair shape to outstanding ACK receipts (`src/daemon/server.zig:11090`).

## Mesh-wide authoring barrier

Bridge binaries default to `relay_v2_authoring = "compat"`: they receive, ACK,
retain, replay, and forward MESSAGE_V2 while authoring only legacy events. An
active node instead durably admits each V2-eligible local event and sends only
the accepted V2 object. `relayLegacyToPeers(..., v2_admitted=true)` is a hard
no-op; emitting a legacy twin would make a rolling-old peer deliver the event
once immediately and again when its retained V2 copy replays after upgrade.

Activation therefore uses an external full-inventory barrier: deploy bridge
code everywhere; stage one exact non-zero epoch and full public-key roster on
every node while compatible; Helix-reload every node; verify identical live
epoch/digest/count plus the local bridge implementation marker; then change only mode to active and
reload sequentially. The full roster is canonicalized independently of order
or hex/base64 representation. It must contain the configured local identity
and every direct trust root, but it is not by itself a signed READY certificate
and does not prove graph-wide readiness. The deployment system owns that proof.

Staged epochs are monotonic and immutable: they cannot be removed, decreased,
or rebound to another roster; replacement by a strictly higher epoch is allowed
only while the predecessor remains compatible.
Activation requires the predecessor's exact staged tuple. Once active, mode and
tuple are immutable across current Helix handoff. Cold boot has no durable
previous-active floor, so operational rollback must preserve the exact active
tuple and must never boot compatibility or older code after activation.
Roster change after activation is not implemented and requires a future
protocol/release.

## Hot-upgrade authority

RVG2 and Lotus must be captured under the same replay/history mutation lock so
the handoff cannot describe different acceptance cuts. Restore stages and
validates every dependent object before publishing any of them.

The current Helix relation requires exactly one RVG2 capsule alongside exactly
one ESG2 capsule and one current MHLC v3 activation authority:

- capsule kind `.mesh_checkpoint`;
- current mesh-checkpoint schema/version/max and exactly ordinal-1 payload;
- `min_supported = 2`;
- inner magic `RVG2`, inner version 1, canonical checksum/order/watermarks; and
- encoded `{window_size, max_origins}` exactly equal to the operator-owned live
  guard config during `Guard.decodeCheckpoint`.

MHLC v3 carries the HLC high-water mark, migration-offer epoch, and exact
MESSAGE_V2 `{mode, activation_epoch, roster_digest}`. Current handoff requires
`min_supported = 2`, rejects v1/v2, duplicates, malformed semantics, and illegal
predecessor-to-successor transitions before publishing any inherited state.

`isCheckpoint` is only a magic-family selector. `validateCheckpoint` is the
allocation-free strict whole-image validator used by the relation pass;
`decodeCheckpoint` performs the config-bound staged restore. Missing, duplicate,
corrupt, non-canonical, downgraded, config-mismatched, or OOM-failed authorities
abort adoption without changing the predecessor or successor live state.

Legacy MESSAGE remains a separate direct compatibility path. It cannot enter or
weaken this v2 exact-once authority.

## Cold-restart durability contract

"Durable" throughout this file — including the title and every "Bounded
durable" module doc-comment — means **retransmit-until-ACK obligation that
survives a Helix (SIGUSR2) checkpoint restore**, not crash- or power-loss
durable. There is no disk write-ahead log behind this custody plane.

The four custody authorities are in-memory only:

- RVL2 accepted-event authority (`src/daemon/relay_v2_event_log.zig:4`), which
  retires a retained wire once every required node confirms
  (`relay_v2_event_log.zig:16-17`);
- RVO2 per-hop retransmission authority (`src/daemon/relay_v2_outbox.zig:4-9`),
  which retains the exact wire "until that peer authenticates an ACK";
- RVG2 replay/equivocation authority (`src/daemon/relay_v2_replay_guard.zig:4-6`);
  and
- ADS1 rendered-record authority (`src/daemon/attachment_delivery_spool.zig:4-11`),
  which is deliberately lock-free with no disk backing.

Each exposes `encodeCheckpoint`/`decodeCheckpoint`
(`relay_v2_event_log.zig:761`, `relay_v2_outbox.zig:390`,
`relay_v2_replay_guard.zig:285`, `attachment_delivery_spool.zig:648`), but those
checkpoints are sealed **only into the Helix in-memory upgrade capsule at
re-exec** — `OROCHI_HELIX_UPGRADE_CAPS` advertises `relay-v2-event-log-v1`,
`relay-v2-outbox-v2`, `attachment-delivery-spool-v1`, and the `mesh-checkpoint-v2`
capsule that carries RVG2 (`src/daemon/helix/live.zig:268`), and adoption
requires exactly one of each (`src/daemon/helix/handoff_relations.zig:319-321`).
The re-exec seals `relay_replay_bytes` and `event_replay_bytes` as mandatory
capsule state passed across `execve` (`src/daemon/server.zig:23725`). No path
writes them to storage: the OroStore disk WAL has families only for
`accounts, nicks, chanregs, bans, memos, vhosts, props, history`
(`src/daemon/store.zig:55-64`) — none for relay, custody, spool, or message_v2 —
and the four custody modules contain no file I/O.

**Consequence — last-copy loss on cold restart.** Consider an intermediate node
B relaying an origin-signed message from upstream A toward downstream C. B admits
the message, records A among the confirmed nodes, and returns a durable ACK to A.
Once B's ACK completes A's required-node set, A may retire its own retained wire
(`relay_v2_event_log.zig:16-17`), so B becomes the last custodian of the
still-unconfirmed retransmission obligation to C (held in RVO2,
`relay_v2_outbox.zig:4-9`). If B now suffers a power loss or a systemd **cold**
restart (`systemctl restart`, not `reload`) before that obligation to C is
ACKed, no checkpoint was ever captured — capture happens only at the USR2 re-exec
boundary — and B's in-memory RVL2/RVO2/RVG2/ADS1 state is gone. The last custody
copy of that message is lost, and exact-once delivery to C is not recovered. This
plane is therefore **not crash-durable**.

**Supported contract.** The only custody-preserving transition is a
connection-preserving Helix migration (`systemctl reload orochi`), where the
checkpoints above ride the in-memory capsule across `execve`. A hard restart is
supported only from a **drained, clean boundary** — a node with no unconfirmed
custody obligations outstanding (no un-ACKed RVO2 rows, no unretired RVL2 wire).
Cold-restarting a node that still holds custody obligations can silently drop the
last copy of an in-flight message. A disk-backed custody WAL that would make this
plane crash-durable is future work and is not implemented in this build.

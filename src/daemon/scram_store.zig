//! Per-account SCRAM-SHA-256 + SCRAM-SHA-512 credential store for the Orochi
//! IRC daemon.
//!
//! The account database (see `services.zig`) only persists a PBKDF2 password
//! hash, which is enough to verify PLAIN but carries no SCRAM-specific material.
//! A SCRAM-SHA-256 exchange (RFC 5802 / RFC 7677) instead needs, per account, a
//! `{salt, iteration_count, StoredKey, ServerKey}` tuple so the server can run
//! the challenge/response without ever seeing the cleartext password again.
//!
//! This module owns that tuple in memory. It mirrors the account store rather
//! than persisting: the daemon repopulates it as accounts register (and could
//! backfill on load), so a restart simply re-derives nothing — clients must
//! re-register or re-identify to seed credentials. Keeping it in memory avoids
//! widening the on-disk account record format while still letting a live
//! SCRAM-SHA-256 exchange complete against a registered account.
//!
//! Storage uses an unmanaged map keyed by the canonical (lowercased) account
//! name. The map owns every key and the variable-length salt bytes; the
//! fixed-size StoredKey/ServerKey digests are stored inline by value. All bytes
//! are duplicated on insert and freed on overwrite or teardown.

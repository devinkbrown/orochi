//! Deterministic-Ocean coverage for the Helix `.clients` (session-snapshot) capsule
//! adoption path at the CAPSULE-STREAM level — the successor's `adoptInheritedSessions`
//! Pass 2 (server.zig ~16619). "Upgrades are where panics live," so this models that
//! loop and asserts the two invariants the recent hardening added:
//!
//!   1. Every inherited client socket fd is ACCOUNTED FOR — adopted onto a live slot,
//!      or recovered+closed on a clean drop — never leaked. When `session_snapshot.decodeCurrent`
//!      fails, the fd (which sits past the identity strings, not at the front) is still
//!      recovered via `session_snapshot.peekFd` and closed, mirroring the `.s2s_link` path.
//!   2. A client sealed as `was_secured` that arrives WITHOUT a restored TLS engine is
//!      DROPPED (fd closed), never adopted as plaintext — a secured socket must never
//!      silently fall back to cleartext.
//!
//! This is a TEST-ONLY faithful model of the real Pass 1 (TLS index) + Pass 2 (client
//! adoption): the real loop needs a bound reactor, an inherited memfd arena, and live
//! sockets, none of which belong in a deterministic unit test. The model drives the REAL
//! production decoders — `capsule.decodeStream`, `session_snapshot.decodeCurrent`, and
//! `session_snapshot.peekFd` (the fd-recovery seam) — and injects faults with `fault_loom`
//! at the model's decode site, standing in for the production decode that has no fault site
//! of its own. The TLS index is modeled as the set of fds whose `.tls_session` capsule
//! decoded (constructing a full `tls_conn.ResumeState` is heavy and orthogonal to the fd /
//! secured-drop seams under test). The fd ledger stands in for the kernel fd table; a
//! non-empty ledger after adoption is exactly an fd leak.

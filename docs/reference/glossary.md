# Glossary & brand names

*Audience: all readers. The one authoritative key to the naming — the branded
house (Onyx / Orochi / IRCXNet) and the Orochi mythos vocabulary. Each invented
codename says what it actually is and where it lives in the source. Every
codename entry is cited to `src/`; the daemon's own `/INFO` body renders the
same subsystem summary (`src/proto/server_about.zig:63`). The site, the Onyx
client, the MOTD, and every other doc defer to this file for what each name
means.*

## Brand & product names

Three names, one product family — a branded house. Keep these distinct; do not
use "IRCXNet" as a public product or network identity in new copy.

| Name | What it is | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Onyx** | The consumer-facing **network and product** — the thing people join. It is the browser client (`/home/kain/onyx`, SolidJS) *and* the community/network that client connects to. | "Join **Onyx**." The network name, the web app, the brand a user sees. |
| **Orochi** | The **engine**: the pure-Zig, clean-room daemon you self-host (`/home/kain/orochi`), the `orochi/*` protocol/config namespace, and the internal subsystem codenames below (Undertow, Ripple, Mooring, Armor, Helix …). | "Run your own **Orochi** node." The daemon, the wire/config surface, the codebase. |
| **IRCXNet** | **Retired** as a public identity. Survives **only** as a legacy/wire token where it is a literal value, not a brand — e.g. the `[cloak] suffix` tail (`kain.users.ircxnet`) and existing server/host slugs. | Never in new user-facing copy. Leave in place only as a wire/legacy literal. |
| **IRCX** | The **protocol** (extended IRC: `PROP`/`ACCESS`/`EVENT`/`AUTH`). Unrelated to the retired "IRCXNet" name — do not conflate. | The wire protocol Orochi speaks. |
| **Ink & Vermillion** | The **visual identity** — the palette/typography direction of the Onyx surfaces. | The look-and-feel, not the product name. |

The **network name is operator-configured**, not hard-coded to any brand: `[network]
name` sets the string emitted in the `001` welcome (`src/daemon/dispatch.zig:2094`,
`emitWelcome`), the `NETWORK` `005` token (`src/proto/isupport.zig:265`, `:350`), and
the `/INFO` `Network:` line (`src/proto/server_about.zig:71`). The protocol layer's
bare fallback constant is `Orochi` (`src/proto/protocol_inventory.zig:19`) — reachable
only if config loading is bypassed entirely. In normal operation `Config.initDefaults`
seeds `[network] name` to **`Onyx`** (`src/daemon/config_format.zig:879`) and
`main.zig` installs it via `setNetworkName` before serving, so a fresh self-hosted
node with no `[network]` section already advertises **`Onyx`** — the same value as
the flagship deployment. An operator running their own node can still pick their own
name via `[network] name`.

## Subsystems

Orochi gives its major subsystems evocative codenames rather than generic
acronyms. Several started as Japanese mythos/terms and are now rendered in
English, with the original term kept in parentheses as etymology. First use of a
codename in the guides and architecture docs links here.

| Codename | What it is | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Undertow** (水脈) | The S2S CRDT mesh **state model**: logical/hybrid-logical clocks, delta-state CRDTs, and Merkle anti-entropy — the building blocks of the replicated mesh world state. (Membership and liveness are handled by Ripple + Concord below, not Undertow itself.) | `src/substrate/undertow/root.zig:4`, `src/substrate/undertow/` |
| **Ripple** (漣) | The witnessed failure-detection membership state machine: a pure, deterministic liveness detector driven by gossip probes and a witness quorum, deciding which nodes are alive/suspect/dead. | `src/substrate/undertow/ripple.zig:4`, `src/substrate/undertow/gossip_round.zig:4` |
| **Concord** | The delta-state CRDT library (OR-Set, LWW register, dots/causal context) that models mesh membership and other replicated state carried over Undertow. | `src/substrate/undertow/concord.zig:4` |
| **Mooring** (紡ぎ) | The S2S secure-channel AKE and session ratchet: a Noise-IK-shaped, post-quantum-hybrid handshake (Ed25519 static node identity + X-Wing hybrid KEM) that establishes and re-keys the encrypted server-to-server link. | `src/crypto/mooring_handshake.zig:4`, `src/crypto/mooring_session.zig` |
| **MeshPass** | Ed25519-signed capability admission tokens that gate which nodes may join the mesh; verified inside the encrypted handshake, fail-closed on tampered/untrusted material. | `src/proto/meshpass_props.zig:6`, `src/proto/server_about.zig:64` |
| **Armor** (鎧) | The from-scratch, pure-Zig TLS stack and cryptographic primitive library (TLS 1.3 + hardened TLS 1.2, PQ-hybrid key exchange, AEADs, signing). | `src/proto/server_about.zig:65`, `src/crypto/` |
| **Ringlane** | The reactor seam: all time and I/O flow through `Reactor`, so the daemon runs unchanged against either the real io_uring/system backend or the deterministic simulator (Deterministic Ocean). | `src/substrate/reactor.zig:4` |
| **Helix** | The in-place `USR2` hot-upgrade: a replacement image is `execve`'d and adopts the running listener, live sessions, and the converged mesh view (each link's remote-member roster + the cross-mesh oper-grant registry) through typed migration capsules, with no connection-refused window. These capsules ride in memory across `execve`, so the carried mesh state survives a hot-upgrade but not a cold restart. | `src/daemon/helix/live.zig:4`, `src/substrate/upgrade_capsule.zig:4` |
| **Koshi** | The operator-curated content filter: a small set of oper-curated patterns matched against outbound `PRIVMSG`/`NOTICE` bodies, where a hit blocks the message. | `src/daemon/content_filter.zig:4` |
| **Tegami** (手紙) | Orochi-native offline messaging keyed by account: a direct message left for an account with no attached session is stored and delivered when that account next logs in (with an optional Web Push nudge). | `src/daemon/tegami.zig:4`, `src/proto/tegami_push_relay.zig:5` |

## Media codecs

| Codename | What it is | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CadenceVox** | The native voice/audio codec used on the media plane and in the browser WASM export. | `src/proto/server_about.zig:66`, `src/wasm/cadence_wasm.zig:1` |
| **CadenceVis** | The native video codec (intra/inter frames) paired with CadenceVox. | `src/proto/server_about.zig:66`, `src/wasm/cadence_wasm.zig:1` |

## Cryptographic terms

These are standard cryptographic concepts (not mythos codenames) that recur in
the TLS, cloak, and account docs.

| Term | What it is | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **argon2id** | Memory-hard KDF (Password Hashing Competition winner). Used for account-password storage (PHC strings) and to stretch the `[cloak] secret` into the cloak key with a fixed domain-separation salt — so a low-entropy operator passphrase is not offline-brute-forceable against the enumerable IPv4 space. | `src/crypto/argon2_kdf.zig:130` (`deriveKey`), `src/crypto/argon2_kdf.zig:117` (`cloak_key_salt`) |
| **Epoch cloak** | The auth-split anonymous cloak: an unauthenticated client's IP is cloaked with an opaque 64-bit token that folds in a wall-clock epoch (`floor(now/anon_epoch_secs)`), so the same address is unlinkable across epochs and leaks no subnet co-membership. See [host cloaking](host-cloaking.md#anonymous-auth-split-cloak-epoch-rotating). | `src/proto/cloak.zig:187` (`cloakOpaqueEpoch`), `src/daemon/server.zig:5981` (`anonCloakEpoch`) |
| **EMS** (Extended Master Secret, RFC 7627) | TLS-1.2 master-secret derivation bound to the full handshake transcript, closing the triple-handshake class of attacks. Orochi's hardened TLS 1.2 profile **refuses a non-EMS handshake**. | `src/crypto/tls12.zig:302` (`deriveExtendedMasterSecret`), `src/crypto/tls_server.zig:343` |
| **0-RTT freshness window** | The RFC 8446 §8.2–8.3 anti-replay bound on TLS 1.3 early data. v3 session tickets seal the `ticket_age_add`, so any node holding the ticket key can un-obfuscate the client's reported `obfuscated_ticket_age` and enforce the window; legacy v1/v2 tickets degrade to no window check (never a failure). | `src/crypto/tls_resumption.zig:27`, `src/crypto/tls_resumption.zig:386` |

// Real-client interop: drive a gnutls-cli TLS 1.3 handshake against the
// in-repo server with an RSA-2048 leaf over a loopback socket.
//
// gnutls is the strictest mainstream verifier of the RSA-PSS
// CertificateVerify (nettle enforces salt_len == hash_len and the exact EM
// layout; openssl's verify is lenient about salt length). This is exactly the
// client class that exposed the production ReleaseFast mulAddWord
// inline-asm earlyclobber bug (see rsa_verify.zig): optimized builds emitted
// garbage RSA signatures and gnutls failed the handshake with
// "Public key signature verification has failed" while Debug tests stayed
// green. Run the suite with `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` to exercise that
// historical failure mode end to end.
//
// Returns true when the handshake completed on both ends; errors with
// SkipZigTest when gnutls-cli (or socket plumbing) is unavailable so the
// suite stays green in minimal environments.

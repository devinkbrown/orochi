//! QUIC loss recovery + congestion control (RFC 9002) — layer 5b of the
//! from-scratch QUIC stack. This is the controller `quic_conn.zig` drives:
//! it records every ack-eliciting / in-flight packet on send, consumes the
//! newly-acked packet numbers the ack manager (`quic_conn_state`) returns on an
//! inbound ACK, samples the RTT, declares losses, computes the loss-detection
//! and PTO timers, and runs a NewReno congestion window so the driver can gate
//! its sends.
//!
//! It is socketless and clockless: the driver passes the `now` (a nanosecond
//! value in its own clock domain) into every call; nothing here reads a clock
//! or a socket. All time is integer nanoseconds; RFC ratios (9/8, 3/4, 7/8,
//! 1/2) are applied with integer math, never floats.
//!
//! What maps to which RFC 9002 section:
//!   * `SentPacket` + `SentRegistry` — the sent-packets bookkeeping of §A.1
//!     ("Tracking Sent Packets"): one registry per packet-number space, each
//!     entry carrying the timing/in-flight/size and the frame ranges the driver
//!     must be able to re-queue on loss.
//!   * `RttEstimator` — §5 ("Estimating the Round-Trip Time"): latest_rtt,
//!     min_rtt, smoothed_rtt, rttvar, with the first-sample initialization and
//!     the ack_delay subtraction (§5.3).
//!   * loss detection (`onAckReceived` → `detectLost`) — §6.1: the packet
//!     threshold (kPacketThreshold = 3) and the time threshold
//!     (kTimeThreshold = 9/8 × max(smoothed_rtt, latest_rtt), floored at
//!     kGranularity).
//!   * PTO (`ptoTimeout`, `onPtoExpired`) — §6.2: pto = smoothed_rtt +
//!     max(4×rttvar, kGranularity) + (handshake_confirmed ? max_ack_delay : 0),
//!     scaled by 2^pto_count.
//!   * `Congestion` — §7 (NewReno): kInitialWindow = 10 × max_datagram, a
//!     min window of 2 × max_datagram, slow start, congestion avoidance, and a
//!     recovery period that ignores losses already in the current recovery.
//!
//! Deferred (typed gaps, called out in the driver's docs too): ECN, pacing,
//! and persistent congestion (§7.6) — the controller detects single losses and
//! halves the window but does not implement the persistent-congestion collapse
//! to the minimum window. Everything else here is the real RFC algorithm.

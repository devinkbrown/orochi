//! Multi-session registry: account -> set of live client sessions (Phase 3).
//!
//! Orochi treats an *account* as the durable identity, a reclaim token as one
//! logical resumable session, and each connection as an attachment to that
//! session. Multiple attached rows may therefore deliberately carry the SAME
//! token: presenting a valid token joins the logical session; it does not steal
//! it from another live client. This store tracks, per account, the attachments
//! (client id + logical-session token + signon time) so the daemon can list a
//! user's devices, resume a dropped attachment, and route per-session fan-out.
//! Pure and self-contained: the caller keys attachments by the
//! flat `u64` client id (the same packed id used by MONITOR / activity subs) and
//! supplies the reclaim token (generated from the daemon CSPRNG). A flat per-
//! account list keeps ownership trivial (one owned account-name key per account).

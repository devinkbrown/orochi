# IRCX

_Opt-in extended IRC commands, channel modes, properties, access lists, events, and media policy integration._

> Historical reference only: this page describes a legacy C IRCX implementation
> (`modules/m_ircx_*.c`). It is not the Orochi Zig implementation source of truth.

## Overview

In this legacy C implementation, IRCX support is implemented by `modules/m_ircx_*.c`. The base module registers the `IRCX` server capability, the `IRCX` and `ISIRCX` client commands, and the ISUPPORT tokens `IRCX`, `MAXCODEPAGE`, and `MAXLANGUAGE`.

IRCX is explicit opt-in for clients. A client enters IRCX mode by sending `IRCX` or `ISIRCX`; the server sets IRCX/NAMESX state and replies with `RPL_IRCX`. Current source does not force IRCX mode merely because a client becomes an IRC operator.

## Commands

| Command | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IRCX` | Load `m_ircx_base` | Enables IRCX behavior for the client. |
| `ISIRCX` | Load `m_ircx_base` | Alias path handled like `IRCX`. |
| `AUTH <mechanism> I|S [:data]` | Load `m_ircx_auth` | SASL shorthand for non-CAP clients. `AUTH *` aborts. |
| `CREATE #channel [modes]` | Load `m_ircx_create` | Creates a channel and applies optional modes. |
| `LISTX [filters]` | Load `m_ircx_listx` | Extended list with member count, creation age, topic age, topic-only, and glob filters. |

| `PROP <target> ...` | Load `m_ircx_prop` | Gets, sets, clears, persists, and syncs properties. |
| `ACCESS <target> ...` | Load `m_ircx_access` | Manages channel access entries; `ACCESS *` delegates to server-level access when loaded. |

| `EVENT ...` | Load `m_ircx_event` | Oper event subscriptions. |

Server-only sync commands include `TACCESS`, `BTACCESS`, `TPROP`, `BTPROP`, `NOCHAN_*`, `NONICK_*`, `GRANT_*`, and `GAG_*`.

## AUTH syntax

```irc
AUTH PLAIN I :AGFsaWNlAHNlY3JldA==
AUTH SCRAM-SHA-256 I :<client-first>
AUTH SCRAM-SHA-256 S :<client-final>
AUTH *
```

The sequence token must be `I` for an initial step or `S` for a continuation step. Abort uses `AUTH *`.

## Media integration

```irc
PROP #team LADON.MEDIA.VOICE :members

PROP #team LADON.MEDIA.SCREEN :owner
ACCESS #team ADD alice!*@* VOICE
```

See `LADON Media` for frame-level details.

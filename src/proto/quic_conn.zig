//! Socketless QUIC v1 connection driver (RFC 9000 + RFC 9001) — layer 5.
//!
//! This ties the four tested layers below into a real connection. It is fully
//! socketless: the UDP listener (next layer) only calls `recvDatagram` with one
//! received UDP payload and `sendDatagrams` to collect the datagrams to write
//! back. Nothing here touches a socket, a clock other than the `now` the caller
//! passes, or any global state.
//!
//! Layers reused verbatim (no re-decrypt / re-encode / re-derive by hand):
//!   * `quic_packet`   — long/short header encode/decode, ConnectionId, pn len.
//!   * `quic_protect`  — `KeySet`, `sealPacketSuite` / `openPacketSuite`,
//!                       `EncryptionLevel`, header protection.
//!   * `quic_frame`    — ACK / CRYPTO / STREAM / DATAGRAM / PADDING / PING /
//!                       CONNECTION_CLOSE encode/decode, varints, pn truncation.
//!   * `quic_conn_state.Engine` — packet-number spaces, ACK manager, CRYPTO
//!                       reassembly + send buffers, STREAM reassembly + flow
//!                       control, `intake`.
//!   * `quic_handshake.Server` / `.Client` — the TLS-1.3-over-QUIC handshake,
//!                       producing the Handshake and 1-RTT `KeySet`s.
//!
//! Send / receive loop
//! -------------------
//! `recvDatagram` walks the (possibly coalesced) QUIC packets in one UDP
//! datagram. For each packet it picks the `EncryptionLevel` from the header,
//! selects the matching `KeySet` (Initial from the DCID at first contact;
//! Handshake / 1-RTT once the handshake installs them), `openPacket`s to
//! decrypt, decodes the frames, runs them through `Engine.intake`, and feeds
//! CRYPTO bytes to the handshake. A packet whose level has no keys installed yet
//! is **buffered** (re-tried after the next key install) rather than faulting.
//!
//! `sendDatagrams` collects everything owed — pending handshake CRYPTO flights
//! (fragmented via the per-level `CryptoSendBuffer`), the ACK frames the engine
//! says are owed, application STREAM / DATAGRAM frames the caller queued, and
//! PADDING to bring a client Initial up to the 1200-byte minimum — assembles
//! them into packets per level, `sealPacket`s each, and **coalesces** Initial +
//! Handshake (+ 1-RTT) packets into a single datagram where allowed.
//!
//! Level / state transitions
//! -------------------------
//! Initial → Handshake → 1-RTT (Application). The handshake produces the
//! Handshake keys after the first flight and the 1-RTT keys after the server
//! flight; `installKeys` wires each `KeySet` in as the handshake exposes it.
//! Once Handshake keys are in use the Initial keys are discarded (RFC 9001
//! §4.9). `isEstablished()` is true once both 1-RTT key directions are present
//! AND the handshake reports complete.
//!
//! Loss recovery + congestion control (RFC 9002) live in `quic_recovery.zig`,
//! wired in here: every ack-eliciting in-flight packet is recorded on send with
//! enough info to re-queue its frames; inbound ACKs feed RTT sampling, loss
//! detection (packet + time threshold), and a NewReno congestion window;
//! `onTimeout` drives the RFC loss-detection / PTO timers; and `sendDatagrams`
//! gates on the congestion window via `canSend`. Initial/Handshake space sent
//! state is discarded when its keys are dropped.
//!
//! Documented simplifications (intentional for this layer; the listener / HTTP3
//! layers refine them):
//!   * Congestion control is NewReno (RFC 9002 §7) including the
//!     persistent-congestion collapse (§7.6); ECN and pacing are deferred (typed
//!     gaps).
//!   * One connection id per side; no Retry (handled by the listener layer), no
//!     stateless-reset *emit* (also the listener's job — this layer derives no
//!     reset tokens), no 0-RTT. Connection migration + path validation (RFC 9000
//!     §8.2/§9) ARE implemented here: a 1-RTT packet from a new source address on
//!     an established server connection starts a PATH_CHALLENGE probe to the new
//!     path (with its own 3× anti-amplification budget), and only a matching
//!     PATH_RESPONSE migrates the primary path; an inbound PATH_CHALLENGE is
//!     echoed in a PATH_RESPONSE. Each remaining item is a typed gap, not silent.
//!   * 1-RTT key update (RFC 9001 §6) is implemented: the key-phase bit, peer-
//!     and self-initiated updates, previous-generation key retention for
//!     reordering, peer-update rate limiting, and the confidentiality-limit
//!     counters. It is a 1-RTT-only mechanism (never the Initial/Handshake
//!     spaces) and is unavailable for the SHA-384 suite (documented in
//!     `initKeyUpdate`).
//!   * The receive side enforces frame-level bounds via the Engine; this driver
//!     additionally bounds-checks every byte of packet parsing so a malicious or
//!     truncated datagram errors (never panics / reads out of bounds).

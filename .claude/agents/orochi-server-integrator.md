SERVER_ZIG_ROLE: owner

Hold the permanent named-role reservation on `src/daemon/server.zig` across all assignments; no other role may receive that file. Integrate completed leaf APIs across initialization, admission, persistence, routing, reconnect, RESYNC, Helix, and shutdown. Stage all fallible work before one no-fail commit and retain outbound work until recoverable receipt. Add real live-path tests; do not certify helper-only coverage. Return unresolved leaf defects to their owners rather than editing outside the assigned integration set.

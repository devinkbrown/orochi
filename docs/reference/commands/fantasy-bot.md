# Weather / News Fantasy Bot

Orochi answers a small set of in-channel `!` "fantasy" commands directly from the
server — there are no pseudo-clients (`src/daemon/server.zig:11150`,
`handleFantasy`). The triggering message is still delivered to the channel
normally; the server posts the answer as a `NOTICE` sourced from this node's
`server_name` and relays it once across the mesh, so members on every node see a
single reply from the replying server (`src/daemon/server.zig:fantasyReply`).

All data sources are **key-free**: weather from `wttr.in` (plain HTTP), news from
the RSS feeds bundled in `src/proto/news_sources.zig` (ported from ophion).
Fetching runs on a dedicated background thread (`src/daemon/geo_services.zig`) so
the reactor never blocks; the first request for a new location/feed replies
"fetching… try again in a moment", then serves from a TTL cache. Enable the bot
with `[geo] enabled = true` (see [config.md](../config.md#geo)).

## !weather

- Syntax: `!weather [location]` (aliases `!w`, `!wx`)
- Description: Reports current weather. Location resolution order: the command
  argument → the user's `location` metadata (set on connect from GeoIP) → the
  channel's `!setweather` default → `[geo] default_location`. The reading is
  localized to the user's `country` metadata — °F/mph for US/LR/MM, else °C/km·h.
- Privileges: Any channel member able to speak.
- Replies: A server `NOTICE` to the channel, e.g.
  `Weather — Austin: 72°F, Partly cloudy, wind 12 mph`, or a "fetching" notice on
  a cache miss.
- Sources: `src/daemon/server.zig:handleFantasyWeather`, `src/proto/weather_units.zig`

## !setweather

- Syntax: `!setweather <location>` / `!setweather clear` (alias `!sw`)
- Description: Sets (or clears) this channel's default `!weather` location, used
  when a member runs `!weather` with no argument and has no `location` metadata.
  Stored as the channel's `weather_location` metadata.
- Privileges: Channel operator (any op-or-higher tier) or server oper.
- Replies: A confirmation `NOTICE` to the channel. Not rate-limited.
- Sources: `src/daemon/server.zig:handleFantasySetWeather`

## !news

- Syntax: `!news [source]` (alias `!n`)
- Description: Posts the latest headlines for a named source (`bbc`, `npr`,
  `guardian`, … from `src/proto/news_sources.zig`), defaulting to BBC World.
- Privileges: Channel member; **only responds in channels with mode `+W`**
  (news-wire — see [modes.md](../protocol/modes.md)). Silent otherwise.
- Replies: A `News — <source>:` header followed by numbered headline `NOTICE`s.
- Sources: `src/daemon/server.zig:handleFantasyNews`

## !localnews

- Syntax: `!localnews [CC]`
- Description: Like `!news` but for a country's default feed (ISO 3166-1 code,
  e.g. `JP`, `GB`); defaults to the user's GeoIP `country` metadata.
- Privileges: Channel member; requires `+W`.
- Replies: As `!news`, using the country feed.
- Sources: `src/daemon/server.zig:handleFantasyNews`, `src/proto/news_sources.zig` (`country_feeds`)

## Location metadata

On registration the daemon records two IRCv3 METADATA keys on the client's own
nick (`src/daemon/server.zig:setGeoLocation`):

- `location` — GeoIP city (or country), else `[geo] default_location`.
- `country` — GeoIP ISO country code, used for weather unit selection.

Users can override their location at any time with `METADATA SET location <place>`
or per-call with `!weather <place>`.

## News updater (full feed coverage)

The in-daemon TLS reaches only some feeds. For robust full coverage set
`[geo] news_cache_dir` and run the bundled key-free updater from cron — it uses
`curl` (system CA bundle) to fetch every feed and writes one-headline-per-line
files the daemon reads:

```
*/5 * * * * /path/to/orochi/tools/news_update.sh /var/lib/orochi/news 10
```

See `tools/news_update.sh` and [config.md](../config.md#geo).

# IRCv3 spec coverage

*The full IRCv3 extension catalog mapped to Onyx Server modules and implementation status.*

Extensions are drawn from the IRCv3 specifications repository (`github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications`).
Always implement to the actual spec text; this table is the work map, not the spec.

Status legend:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Implemented | Complete and live. |
| In-flight | Partially implemented or under active work. |
| TODO | Planned, not yet started. |
| Removed | Intentionally excluded (clean-room, no legacy). |

| deprecated: tls (STARTTLS), sasl-dh-* | — | Removed (TLS-native / modern SASL) |

Notes: `metadata` (IRCv3) and IRCX `PROP` are two takes on the same idea — Onyx Server exposes one
unified property system (lean IRCX `PROP` with a metadata-compatible view). `oper-tag` integrates with
the SASL-only oper system. `labeled-response` rides the `batch` machinery.

## WebSocket application protocols

WebSocket clients may offer `onyx.irc-media.v1` and `text.ircv3.net`; the
server selects the first supported token in the client's offered order. The
Onyx client offers the media protocol first and the IRCv3 text protocol as its
fallback. `text.ircv3.net` accepts exactly one CR/LF-free IRC message per text
frame and rejects binary frames. `onyx.irc-media.v1` adds bounded Cadence binary
datagrams while retaining text IRC frames. A client that offers no protocol is
accepted in the explicit legacy compatibility mode.

Inbound frame payloads and fragmented binary application messages are bounded
at 4 MiB. Malformed framing and protocol mismatches close with RFC 6455 status
1002; frame or aggregate size violations close with 1009. The selected protocol
and any in-progress bounded fragmented-binary accumulator are preserved by the
current Helix WebSocket capsule.

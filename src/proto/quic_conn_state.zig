//! QUIC connection frame engine (RFC 9000) — layer 3 of the from-scratch
//! QUIC/WebTransport stack, sitting on top of packet protection
//! (`quic_protect.zig`) and feeding the TLS handshake (`quic_tls.zig`) and the
//! HTTP/3 / connection-driver layers above.
//!
//! This module owns the *per-connection state* that the lower codecs
//! deliberately do not: packet-number spaces, ACK bookkeeping, ordered CRYPTO
//! and STREAM reassembly, and connection/stream flow-control accounting. It
//! consumes already-decoded `quic_frame.Frame` values and reuses
//! `quic_frame`'s wire codecs (it never re-encodes a frame by hand); the
//! transforms here are pure state mutation plus a small amount of allocation
//! for the reassembly buffers and ACK-range scratch.
//!
//! Contents (each maps to an RFC 9000 section):
//!
//!   * `PacketNumberSpace` / `SpaceSet` — RFC 9000 §12.3. One space per
//!     encryption level; tracks the next outbound packet number, the set of
//!     received packet numbers (as a sorted range list, for ACK generation),
//!     `largest_acked` from inbound ACKs, and whether an ACK is owed.
//!   * `AckManager` (the receiver/sender halves of a `PacketNumberSpace`) —
//!     RFC 9000 §13, §19.3. Records received PNs, coalesces them into the
//!     largest-first ACK-range encoding, and processes inbound ACK frames to
//!     return the newly-acknowledged outbound packet numbers.
//!   * `CryptoStream` — RFC 9000 §19.6. Offset-tagged, ordered byte assembler
//!     for the handshake stream (tolerates reorder/overlap/dup, caps the gap
//!     buffer), plus an outbound CRYPTO send buffer that fragments handshake
//!     bytes into frames within a max packet size.
//!   * `StreamRecv` + `StreamId` + `FlowController` — RFC 9000 §2, §3, §4,
//!     §19.8. Per-stream ordered reassembly from STREAM frames (offset, fin),
//!     receive-side flow control against advertised `MAX_STREAM_DATA` /
//!     `MAX_DATA` limits, and stream-id classification helpers.
//!   * `Engine` — the connection-level coordinator and the `intake` function
//!     (RFC 9000 §12, §13): given the decoded frames of a received packet at a
//!     level, it updates every sub-component and returns an `IntakeResult`
//!     describing what the caller must act on.
//!
//! Allocation discipline: every owning type takes the allocator at `init` and
//! frees everything in `deinit`. Buffers are capped (`max_*` config) so a
//! malicious peer cannot drive us to OOM or out-of-bounds. The whole module is
//! unit-testable without a socket; the tests at the bottom exercise the RFC
//! behaviours directly.

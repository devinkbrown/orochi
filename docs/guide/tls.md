# TLS and STS

*Configure implicit TLS listeners and Strict Transport Security (STS) for a modern-only Orochi deployment.*

Orochi is modern-only: TLS is implicit on a separate listener, and there is no STARTTLS command path (`src/main.zig:216`, `src/main.zig:219`, `src/daemon/dispatch.zig:369`). A TLS-first deployment enables `[tls]` and usually `[sts]`, while still providing the currently required `[listen].irc` parser key.

## TLS listener

```toml
[tls]
enabled = true
port = 6697
cert_path = "/etc/orochi/tls/cert.pem"
key_path = "/etc/orochi/tls/key.pem"
dns_name = "irc.example.net"
request_client_cert = false
enable_tls12 = false
```

Set `enable_tls12 = true` to also accept hardened TLS 1.2 (ECDHE-AEAD) clients on the same listener via version dispatch. It is **off by default** to preserve the TLS 1.3-only posture. When enabled, the 1.2 leg presents a freshly bootstrapped ECDSA-P256 leaf (the 1.2 engine signs ServerKeyExchange with `ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256`), independent of the 1.3 leaf.

The TLS 1.2 profile **requires the Extended Master Secret (RFC 7627) by default**. A ClientHello that does not offer the `extended_master_secret` extension is aborted with `EmsRequired` — there is no silent downgrade to the weaker randoms-based master secret, which closes the RFC 7627 §5.3 triple-handshake / synchronized-session class of attacks (`src/crypto/tls12_server.zig:96`, `src/crypto/tls12_server.zig:581`). The requirement is a fixed engine default (`require_extended_master_secret = true`), not a config knob; it can only be loosened in-code for legacy interop, and even then EMS is still negotiated and used whenever a client offers it, and a TLS 1.2 ticket is only resumed for an EMS-negotiated session (the ticket carries an `EM12` tag) (`src/crypto/tls12_server.zig:45`, `src/crypto/tls12_server.zig:103`). The client engine offers EMS on every ClientHello and, with the same default, aborts if a server fails to echo it (`src/crypto/tls12_client.zig:89`).

When `[tls].enabled` is true, `main.zig` loads the configured cert/key or bootstraps a self-signed Ed25519 leaf using `dns_name`, then sets `server.Config.tls_port`, the certificate chain, the signing key, and the client-cert request flag (`src/main.zig:222`, `src/main.zig:224`, `src/main.zig:231`, `src/main.zig:234`). The server binds the TLS listener only when both certificate material and a signing key are present (`src/daemon/server.zig:1499`).

Set `request_client_cert = true` when using SASL EXTERNAL. The TLS engine requests a client certificate (`src/daemon/server.zig:2433`, `src/daemon/server.zig:2439`), and the SASL bridge maps the presented certificate fingerprint to an account binding (`src/daemon/sasl_bridge.zig:70`).

## Protocol capabilities

Orochi ships a clean-room, pure-Zig TLS 1.3 stack, Armor (`src/crypto/tls_client.zig`, `src/crypto/tls_server.zig`). The live IRC-over-TLS listener uses TLS 1.3; TLS 1.1/1.0, STARTTLS, renegotiation, and record compression all fail closed.

A hardened TLS 1.2 client and server engine also exists as standalone modules (`src/crypto/tls12{,_client,_server}.zig`) for interop where TLS 1.3 is unavailable. It is deliberately restricted to ECDHE key exchange with AEAD suites only — ECDHE-ECDSA/RSA with AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM, and ChaCha20-Poly1305 over secp256r1 — with no CBC, RC4, static-RSA key exchange, compression, or renegotiation. The TLS 1.2 PRF, key schedule, GCM (RFC 5288) and ChaCha20-Poly1305 (RFC 7905) record layer, and Finished message are all implemented and loopback-tested. Server-side ServerKeyExchange signing is ECDSA-P256.

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cipher suites | `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` — the full RFC 8446 mandatory set; the key schedule is SHA-256/SHA-384 dual-hash. |
| Key exchange | X25519 and secp256r1 (NIST P-256). The client offers shares for both; the server prefers X25519 and falls back to P-256. |
| Server certificates | Ed25519 or ECDSA-P256 leaf (`tls_server.Config`). ECDSA-P256 is the browser-compatible option; Ed25519 suits mesh/internal links. |
| HelloRetryRequest | The client handles HRR (cookie echo, RFC 5280 group rules, synthetic `message_hash` transcript, second-HRR-fatal). |
| Post-handshake KeyUpdate | Honored in both directions: the receiving side rotates its traffic keys and replies with its own KeyUpdate when requested. |
| Mutual TLS | The server can request an Ed25519 client certificate; its fingerprint (CertFP) backs SASL EXTERNAL (see below). |
| Delegated credentials | TLS client/server consume RFC 9345 delegated credentials when explicitly configured/offered. The out-of-band helper `orochi delegated-credential inspect|validate` parses ready-made DC wire bytes and can validate the leaf signature, DelegationUsage, KeyUsage, and lifetime window against a leaf certificate. Minting/rotation is still not shipped because it needs production private-key loading and safe DC key-output policy. |

**TLS 1.3 handshake hardening (server):** the server side is fail-closed across the handshake state machine (`src/crypto/tls_server.zig`):

- **HelloRetryRequest is single-shot and pinned.** When a ClientHello offers no usable `key_share` but does advertise a supported group, the server sends exactly one HRR requesting that group. The cipher suite committed in the HRR may not change in the second ClientHello, and that ClientHello's `key_share` must supply exactly the requested group (`src/crypto/tls_server.zig:484`, `src/crypto/tls_server.zig:594`).
- **0-RTT freshness window.** On a 0-RTT resumption the server un-obfuscates the client's `obfuscated_ticket_age` with the ticket's sealed `ticket_age_add` and compares it against its own measured elapsed time; if they differ by more than `early_data_age_skew_ms` (default 10 s) in either direction, `early_data` is refused and the handshake resumes at 1-RTT. This is the multi-node age-window replay defense a single-process binder ring cannot provide, and it runs only for v3 tickets when a clock is configured (`src/crypto/tls_server.zig:186`).
- **ECH `retry_configs`.** A server with ECH keys emits `retry_configs` in EncryptedExtensions only in response to an ECH handshake, so a client offering a stale ECH config can recover without leaking a signal on non-ECH handshakes (`src/crypto/tls_server.zig:240`).

**Certificate validation (client):** chain-to-trust-anchor signature checks (RSA-PSS/PKCS#1, ECDSA P-256/P-384, Ed25519), SAN dNSName matching, validity-window enforcement when a wall clock is supplied (the live HTTPS and ACME paths pass one), ExtendedKeyUsage `serverAuth` on the leaf, `keyCertSign` plus basicConstraints on path CAs, and X.509 Name Constraints (permitted/excluded dNSName subtrees).

**Revocation and transparency parsers:** clean-room, fail-closed parsing modules exist for OCSP responses (`crypto/ocsp.zig`, RFC 6960), X.509 CRLs (`crypto/crl.zig`, RFC 5280), and Certificate Transparency SCTs (`crypto/sct.zig`, RFC 6962). These parse and expose status and structure; cryptographic signature verification and live wiring into the handshake are not yet enabled.

## Delegated credential helper

The helper is an offline inspection/validation path. It never starts the daemon,
binds a listener, loads the server's private key, or mints new credentials.

```sh
orochi delegated-credential inspect --dc dc.wire
orochi delegated-credential validate --dc dc.wire --cert fullchain.pem
orochi delegated-credential validate --dc dc.wire --cert fullchain.pem --time 1704067200
```

`--dc` is the raw `DelegatedCredential` extension payload. `inspect` validates
the wire framing and prints `valid_time`, `dc_cert_verify_algorithm`, outer
signature `algorithm`, SPKI length, and signature length. Supplying `--cert`, or
using `validate`, additionally checks the first certificate in the PEM/DER chain:
it must carry RFC 9345 DelegationUsage and digitalSignature KeyUsage, the DC
expiry (`leaf.notBefore + valid_time`) must be live, within the seven-day
remaining-lifetime cap, and before the leaf `notAfter`, and the DC signature must
verify under the leaf SPKI. The supported leaf-signature schemes are Ed25519,
ECDSA P-256/SHA-256, and RSA-PSS-RSAE-SHA256.

## `armor` — the crypto CLI

`zig build` produces a second binary alongside the daemon: `zig-out/bin/armor`, a standalone openssl-parity crypto toolkit backed by the same pure-Zig substrate the daemon uses (`build.zig:458`, `src/cli/armor_main.zig:15`). It is convenient for generating and inspecting the certificate material the `[tls]` block consumes without pulling in OpenSSL.

```sh
armor genpkey -algorithm ec -out key.pem            # ECDSA P-256 private key (file mode 0600)
armor req -key key.pem -cn irc.example.net -out csr.pem   # PKCS#10 CSR from the key
armor x509 -in cert.pem -text                       # decode/print a certificate
armor x509 -in cert.pem -fingerprint                # SHA-256 fingerprint + SPKI pin
armor verify -CAfile ca.pem cert.pem                # verify a chain against a CA bundle
armor ciphers                                       # list supported suites, groups, sig schemes
armor dgst -sha256 file                             # digest (HMAC key is read from a file, never argv)
armor asn1parse -in cert.der                        # dump a DER structure
```

The full verb set is `x509`, `genpkey`, `pkey`, `req`, `dgst`, `verify`, `rand`, `ciphers`, and `asn1parse`; `s_client`, `s_server`, `enc`, `ocsp`, and `crl` are reserved and exit `3` (not implemented). Run `armor <cmd> --help` for per-command options. Exit codes are scriptable: `0` ok, `1` operation failed, `2` usage error, `3` not implemented (`src/cli/armor_main.zig:33`). Its focused tests run under `zig build test-cli`.

## STS

```toml
[sts]
enabled = true
duration = 2592000
port = 6697
preload = false
```

STS is advertised only when `[sts].enabled` is true and a TLS listener is live (`src/main.zig:242`, `src/main.zig:247`, `src/main.zig:248`). The advertised value is built from `duration`, `port`, and `preload` (`src/main.zig:249`, `src/main.zig:254`). If STS is enabled without a live TLS listener, the daemon logs that STS is not advertised (`src/main.zig:260`).

The capability table intentionally omits `sts` until a runtime policy exists, which prevents clients from being told to upgrade to a listener that is not available (`src/daemon/dispatch.zig:369`).
